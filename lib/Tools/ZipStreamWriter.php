 * A zip file written front to back as its files arrive, to a sink rather
 * than to a file: nothing is seeked back to, so it can go out to the
 * browser while it is being made, and what is held at any moment is one
 * piece of one file.
 *
 * Files are stored, not compressed — what goes in is mostly pictures and
 * videos, compressed already. Each one's CRC and sizes follow its bytes
 * in a data descriptor (they are known only once it is read), and are
 * repeated in the central directory at the end, which is where readers
 * look. Past 4 GB of archive or 65535 files, the offsets and the end
 * records are ZIP64.
 *
 * Only a file said beforehand to be 4 GB or more gets ZIP64 sizes, with
 * the eight-byte data descriptor they need: macOS's Archive Utility reads
 * a stored file up to its descriptor and cannot read one of those. A file
 * of unknown size has to stay under 4 GB.
