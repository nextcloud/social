/**
 * One user's Social data in a Nextcloud account export, and back out of one.
 *
 * What travels is what the account *is* and what it *chose*: the actor's
 * profile and flags, who it follows and who follows it, what it blocks and
 * mutes, what it wrote — with the pictures and videos on it, and the banner
 * over it — and what it kept (bookmarks and favourites). The lists of accounts
 * are written in the shape Mastodon exports them, and the files under
 * `media_attachments/` in the layout Mastodon's own archive uses, so the archive
 * is useful outside Nextcloud too — `following_accounts.csv` is the file
 * `MigrationService::parseFollowsCsv()` reads and the one Mastodon's "Import
 * follows" accepts.
 *
 * What deliberately does not travel:
 *
 * - **the private key.** Without it the imported account cannot sign as the
 *   *old* actor — and it should not be able to. An export archive is an
 *   ordinary file: downloaded, mailed, left in another cloud. The key that a
 *   whole instance's worth of servers accept as proof of identity has no
 *   revocation in ActivityPub, and this app goes as far as encrypting it at
 *   rest (`PrivateKeyCipher`), so putting a plaintext copy in a user-held file
 *   would undo that for the convenience of a case that does not need it: an
 *   account imported on another server is a *new* actor with a new id, and
 *   `AccountService::createActor()` gives it a fresh pair. Identity continuity
 *   is carried by `alsoKnownAs` plus a `Move` from the old server — which is
 *   why the import records the old actor id as an alias — not by copying the
 *   secret. The public key is exported, because it is public and identifies
 *   which actor this was.
 * - **other people's posts.** The local copies of remote statuses are a cache
 *   of somebody else's content; it is re-fetched wherever it is needed and is
 *   not the user's to carry. Only what the user wrote is in `outbox.json`, and
 *   only the files of those posts are copied — and only where this instance
 *   stored them, which a streamed video (`Document::COPY_STREAMED`) never was.
 * - **moderation decisions taken against the account** (`social_moderation`),
 *   reports, the outbound request queue, OAuth clients, tokens and secrets. A
 *   suspension outlives even the deletion of an actor on purpose (see
 *   `PersonInterface::delete()`), so it must not be something a user can shed
 *   by exporting and re-importing, and a credential that survived a move would
 *   be a credential nobody can revoke.
 *
 * The import federates nothing except the follows, which cannot be re-created
 * any other way — see import().
