/**
 * Finding the next video to ladder, laddering it, and keeping the rows honest.
 *
 * The same split as `VideoTranscodingWorker`: `VideoLadderService` knows how to
 * run ffmpeg over a path and nothing about the store, this knows about the
 * store and nothing about ffmpeg's flags, and each half can be tested without
 * the other.
 *
 * The order of operations matters here for a different reason than it does in
 * the transcoder. Nothing is ever *replaced*: the source video stays exactly
 * where it was and keeps being what a plain `<video>` plays. Rungs are an
 * addition, so the failure mode of every step is "no ladder yet", never "a
 * video that 404s". A half-built ladder is torn down rather than published,
 * because a master playlist advertising a rung whose file is not there is a
 * player that stalls rather than one that picks another.
