 * The moderator decisions that go into the server's audit log.
 *
 * Everything here was already written to `social.log` at info level, which is
 * a log nobody keeps and anybody with the app can write to. An administrator
 * asked six months later who suspended an account, or which of three
 * moderators blocked an instance, had the strike history for the two actions
 * that recorded one and nothing at all for the rest.
 *
 * `CriticalActionPerformedEvent` is what core's `admin_audit` app listens for,
 * so these land in the same file, in the same format, as "user X was added to
 * group Y" — kept as long as the audit log is kept, and written by the server
 * rather than by the app. When `admin_audit` is off nothing listens and the
 * event costs a dispatch.
 *
 * The message carries `%s` for each parameter in order: that is how
 * `admin_audit` renders it.
