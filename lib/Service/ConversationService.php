/**
 * Mastodon's conversations, out of a direct timeline that has none.
 *
 * Mastodon stores a conversation: a row per thread, a row per participant, and
 * an id that exists before anybody asks for it. This app stores messages, and
 * the only thing the messages of one exchange have in common is the chain of
 * `in_reply_to` they hang off. A conversation here is therefore *derived*: the
 * thread root — the message with no parent, or the topmost parent this
 * instance stores — is the conversation, and its nid is the conversation's id.
 *
 * That choice is what makes `POST /api/v1/conversations/{id}/read` possible at
 * all. The id has to survive the round trip: a client reads the list, the user
 * taps a row minutes later, and the id they send back has to name the same
 * thread. The root's nid does — it is a stored, immutable, already-unique id,
 * and every message of the thread walks up to the same one. An id derived from
 * the page instead (a position, a hash of the participants, the newest
 * message) would name something else as soon as a message arrived.
 *
 * What it costs:
 *
 *  - Grouping is work at read time. A page of conversations is one direct
 *    timeline query plus one query per level of `in_reply_to` that the page's
 *    messages have above them — bounded, and a direct message is rarely deep.
 *  - A thread whose root is not stored here (the exchange started on another
 *    server and this instance was brought in later) groups under the topmost
 *    message it *does* store. If the missing parent arrives afterwards, the
 *    conversation's id changes. Mastodon has the same hole in a different
 *    place: it threads on the `conversation`/`context` the sender sent, and an
 *    exchange whose sender omits it splits there too.
 *  - Two pages of one list can show the same conversation twice: paging is by
 *    message, so a thread with messages on both sides of the cursor is built
 *    twice, once with an older last message. A client keys on `id`, so it
 *    updates the row rather than growing a second one. Storing conversations
 *    would fix it, and would mean a table written on every incoming direct
 *    message and a backfill of every message already here.
 *
 * Read and dismissed state does have a row — see ConversationsRequest — since
 * neither can be derived from the messages.
