 * too, once a day. Three are offered to begin with — two servers that publish
 * their own moderation, and one shared list — and an admin can point a source
 * at any other server that publishes one.
 *
 * **Off until somebody says otherwise.** A server's moderation is its own, and
 * adopting another server's is a decision an admin makes rather than one they
 * inherit by installing this app. Turning one on is also not reversible by
 * turning it off: a block purges what this instance holds of that server, so
 * the source can stop saying so and the content does not come back.
 *
 * What the list says is applied as the list says it — see
 * `BlocklistImportService`. Nothing here removes an entry the source dropped,
 * either: an admin who looked at an instance and disagreed should not have
 * their decision undone by somebody else's list changing.
