/**
 * The first post an account writes here, and the posts that read like spam.
 *
 * Two switches, both on by default, both an administrator's to turn off:
 *
 *  - **first-post review** holds the first post of an account that has
 *    published nothing here yet. It is the cheapest spam measure there is on a
 *    server whose accounts are Nextcloud users: a spammer has to get an
 *    account on this instance first, and the first thing they do with it is
 *    seen by a person before it reaches anybody else.
 *  - **autospam** holds a post that trips one of a very small set of rules —
 *    a wall of links, or mentions scattered at accounts with no connection to
 *    the author. No wordlist and no score: a queue that says "0.82" tells a
 *    moderator nothing they can act on, while "seven links" is something a
 *    person can agree or disagree with in a second.
 *
 * Two things are never held, and both matter more than the rules do:
 *
 *  - A **direct message**. Holding one would put private correspondence in
 *    front of a moderator who was not addressed, for a machine's reason. A
 *    spammer sending DMs is dealt with by the people who receive them, through
 *    a report — by a person who was actually written to. A direct message does
 *    not count as having posted here either (`StreamRequest::countPostsBy()`):
 *    otherwise an account could send one message to itself and be past
 *    first-post review a second later.
 *  - A post by an account with a **moderation decision** already against it.
 *    That account's posts are being dealt with by whatever the moderator
 *    decided; the queue is for accounts nobody has looked at yet.
 *
 * What is held is the *request*, never a row in `social_stream`. See the
 * migration for why: a held post that existed as a row with a flag on it would
 * be one forgotten predicate away from a timeline, and this app has shipped
 * that leak before.
