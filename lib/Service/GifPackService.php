/**
 * The 881 animated emoji every instance has in its picker from the day the app
 * is installed.
 *
 * **Why they are not in the app.** They are Google's Noto Animated Emoji, and
 * all of them together are over half a gigabyte: 746 KiB apiece at the only
 * size Google publishes. Even re-encoded small enough to be ugly they are
 * 42 MiB, against an app that is 66 MiB in total. So what ships is the *list*
 * — `data/noto-animated-emoji.json`, 70 KiB — and the pictures arrive one at a
 * time, the first time anybody on the instance asks for one, and are kept in
 * appdata for ever after.
 *
 * **What that means for the reader.** Nothing leaves their browser. The grid
 * points at this instance's own `/gif/{slug}`, the same route an administrator's
 * own pictures are served from, and it is the *server* that fetches the file it
 * does not have yet — by codepoint, from a fixed URL, once in the life of the
 * instance. No search term is sent anywhere, and no third party learns who
 * looked at what. That is the property `GifService` was written to protect and
 * the reason a Giphy or Tenor picker was refused; this keeps it.
 *
 * An administrator who wants nothing fetched at all turns the pack off with
 * `occ config:app:set social gif_pack --value=0`, and is left with whatever
 * they added themselves.
