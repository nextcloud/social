	 * A post named by its address, fetched from the server that holds it.

	 * `resolve=true` is a reader saying "I have a link, go and get it" — it is
	 * how somebody replies to or boosts a post they found in a browser, and
	 * without it that is impossible: the post is on another server and nothing
	 * here has ever had a reason to ask for it.
	 *
	 * Fetching an address a reader supplies is the part that needs care, and
	 * three things already stand between this and an open proxy: the route is
	 * rate-limited per user, `CurlService` refuses an instance the access list
	 * bars and pins the address it resolved across redirects, and the document
	 * that comes back has to *claim the id it was fetched from*. That last one
	 * is what stops somebody hosting a document that says it is a post of
	 * yours; it is the same check `StreamQueueService::cacheItem()` makes when
	 * it walks up a thread.
	 *
	 * A post this instance already holds is returned without asking anybody.
	 *
	 * `$asViewer` decides whether that last sentence is subject to who is
	 * asking, and it has to, because the two callers are asking different
	 * questions. A reader pasting an address wants a post *they* may read, so
	 * the search route passes `true`: without it, an address typed into the
	 * search box answered with a followers-only or direct post the reader was
	 * never sent — the content search above it is viewer-scoped and finds
	 * nothing, which is exactly what makes this run. `RelayService` is asking
	 * whether the *instance* already holds an object at all, on nobody's
	 * behalf, and passes `false`.
