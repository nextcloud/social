/**
 * The starter packs other servers publish, read in: the collections of the
 * fediverse, and Bluesky's suggested starter packs.
 *
 * Mastodon 4.6 calls them Collections and federates them as FEP-7aa9
 * `FeaturedCollection`s: a named, ordered list of accounts a curator
 * recommends, linked from the curator's actor as `featuredCollections`.
 * Each entry is a `FeaturedItem` naming the account (`featuredObject`) and
 * the account's own consent to be in it (`featureAuthorization`), which the
 * FEP requires a reader to check: an item whose authorization does not
 * resolve, is not a `FeatureAuthorization`, names another collection or
 * account, or does not live on the account's own server is left out. An
 * authorization whose server does not answer is neither: a member it
 * vouched for before stays, and a collection none of whose members could be
 * checked stays as it was read last time.
 *
 * Which curators are read is the `starter_pack_sources` app value: a JSON
 * array of handles (`user@host`, every public collection of that account),
 * collection addresses (that one collection) and `bluesky:suggested`
 * (Bluesky's suggested starter packs, read by `SuggestedStarterPacks` while
 * Bluesky is on). Unset is the shipped list; `[]` reads nobody and removes
 * what was read. A collection that is not `discoverable`, is marked
 * `sensitive`, or has no verified member is not offered to somebody looking
 * for their first follows, and neither is an account this instance's
 * moderation keeps out (`StarterPackModeration`), as member or as curator.
 *
 * Read by `Cron\StarterPackSources` once a day and by
 * `occ social:starter-packs:refresh`; never on a page. A curator that cannot
 * be reached, or is not reached before the run's deadline, keeps what was
 * read from it last time. A member not in the actor cache yet is queued to
 * be fetched (`RemoteFetchQueue`) rather than fetched by the run.
