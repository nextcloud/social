/**
 * Starter packs: a named handful of accounts worth following.
 *
 * What this exists for is the one question a new account has that no algorithm
 * here can answer. `SuggestionService` works off the follow graph, and on day
 * one there is none -- it falls back to whoever posted recently, which is a list
 * of strangers sorted by luck. A pack is a human answer to a human question.
 *
 * **The packs shipped below are an editorial choice, and a small one on
 * purpose.** They are the official accounts of the projects this app federates
 * with, which is the one set that is defensible without this file becoming a
 * directory nobody agreed to be in: they are organisations rather than people,
 * they are unambiguously the accounts they claim to be, and none of them was
 * added because somebody here liked them. Anything broader is a judgement an
 * instance should make for itself, which is what the config below is for.
 *
 * An administrator replaces or extends them with the `starter_packs` app value,
 * a JSON array of `{slug, name, description, handles}`. Three states, and they
 * are deliberately distinguishable:
 *
 * - unset: the shipped packs;
 * - `[]`: no packs at all, which is the right answer for an instance that would
 *   rather suggest nobody;
 * - a list: the shipped packs, with any entry whose slug matches one of them
 *   replacing it, plus the rest added -- so a shipped pack can be edited rather
 *   than only added to.
 *
 * Nothing here writes a row. The accounts are not this instance's to own and the
 * handles are the only durable reference to them.
