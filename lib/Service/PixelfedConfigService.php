 * What `/api/v2/config` answers: the numbers and switches the Pixelfed app
 * reads once, on launch, before it will draw anything.
 *
 * It is a bootstrap call, not a feature. The app asks for it first and uses the
 * answer to decide how many pictures its picker may select, how long a caption
 * may be, and which screens to offer at all -- so a wrong number here is a
 * client that lets somebody compose a post the server will refuse, and a missing
 * one is an app that will not start.
 *
 * **Every value is derived, never restated.** The ceilings come from the same
 * constants the server enforces and the mime list is asked of the one place that
 * decides what an upload may be. A second copy of any of them would drift, and
 * the failure that causes is the worst kind: the client says yes and the server
 * says no, with nothing in between to explain it.
 *
 * The feature switches say what this app actually does, not what Pixelfed does.
 * Announcing a screen that is not there is worse than not announcing it: the app
 * draws the tab, the reader taps it, and it is empty for a reason nobody can
 * see.
