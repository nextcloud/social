/**
 * The year an account had, as Mastodon's `#Wrapstodon` reports it.
 *
 * Five routes and one entity, and a client that has the feature — the official
 * apps do — shows a card in December that says nothing at all on an instance
 * that does not serve them. What it holds is a year in twelve rows (what was
 * posted, who arrived), the hashtags that were used most, the three posts that
 * travelled furthest, and a one-word description of how the account is used.
 *
 * **Computed on demand and never stored.** Mastodon generates these with a
 * background job and keeps the result, which is why its API has a `generating`
 * state and a `generate` route. Here the same answer comes out of the posts
 * that are already in the database, in one read of the year, so there is
 * nothing to generate and nothing to keep in step: `generate` is a no-op that
 * answers 200 because a client will call it, and the state is `available` or
 * `ineligible` and never `generating`. A report that is a query cannot go
 * stale, and an instance that never runs its cron still has one.
 *
 * **`share_url` is null.** Mastodon's points at a public page of its own; this
 * app has none, and inventing an address would be a link that 404s in
 * somebody's post.
