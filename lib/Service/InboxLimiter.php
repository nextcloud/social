/**
 * A cheap per-origin ceiling on incoming inbox deliveries, applied before the
 * (expensive) signature verification: signatures and replay windows prove
 * authenticity, but nothing else caps how fast a valid-but-hostile peer can
 * fill the stream queue — and the verification itself fetches the signing key,
 * so a flood is expensive long before anything about it is known to be true.
 *
 * The bucket checked before anything is known is the connecting address, which
 * is the one thing about an unauthenticated request the sender cannot choose.
 * The host named in the Signature header's keyId cannot be a bucket of its own
 * there: nothing has checked that the sender has anything to do with it, so
 * counting a request against the host it *names* lets any four cheap addresses
 * fill a large instance's bucket every minute and cut this server off from it —
 * the deliveries that are genuinely from it are then answered 429 and the local
 * timelines simply go quiet. That is a better attack than the one the bucket
 * was there to stop.
 *
 * A per-origin ceiling is still worth having, so it moved behind the signature:
 * assertOriginAllowed() is called with the origin the HTTP signature actually
 * proved, and only a peer that can sign for a host can spend that host's
 * budget.
 *
 * Fixed one-minute windows in `DurableCache`, so the ceiling holds on an
 * instance with no memcache too: in the distributed cache alone it read zero
 * on every delivery there and never refused one. A refused delivery counts
 * as well — a sender that keeps knocking stays over the ceiling. A limit of 0
 * disables the check.
