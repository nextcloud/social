/**
 * What the rest of the fediverse is talking about.
 *
 * `HashtagService` ranks the hashtags used on *this* instance, which on a small
 * server is a list of what the handful of people here posted today -- and on a
 * new one is empty. That is the same circle relays exist to break, and this
 * breaks a smaller part of it without bringing anybody's posts in: it asks
 * other servers what is trending *there* and shows the answer as theirs.
 *
 * **Nothing is stored and nothing is ingested.** No post is fetched, no actor
 * is cached, no row is written. What comes back is a list of strings, kept in
 * the distributed cache for fifteen minutes because trends are recomputed on
 * the hour and a discovery page should not ask forty servers per visit. A tag
 * followed from this page is followed the way any tag is -- see
 * `HashtagService` -- and what fills that timeline is still only what this
 * instance federates with.
 *
 * **Ranked by how many servers named it, not by counts added up.** Instances
 * differ in size by four orders of magnitude, so a sum ranks mastodon.social's
 * opinion above everybody else's; a count of servers is the same model the
 * follow graph already uses, and it is the one a row can explain: "busy on
 * four servers" is a fact a reader can check.
 *
 * **What each kind of server can answer.** The sources are the ones
 * `FediverseDirectoryService` already keeps, since the question "which servers
 * do we ask about people" has the same answer as "which servers do we ask
 * about tags":
 *
 * - `local` -- this instance, from the trend the cron already keeps. Never a
 *   network request, always asked, and marked as this server so the page can
 *   tell "also here" from "only out there".
 * - `mastodon` -- `/api/v1/trends/tags`, public and unauthenticated on
 *   Mastodon and on everything that copies its API. It has **no public tag
 *   search**: `/api/v2/search` needs a token, exactly as it does for accounts.
 *   So a search asks for the same trending page and matches the query against
 *   it, which finds a tag that is busy there and nothing else. That is weaker
 *   than search and is reported as what it is rather than dressed up.
 * - `misskey` -- `hashtags/trend` for the trends and `hashtags/search` for the
 *   search, both public, so a Misskey peer answers a search properly.
 * - `lemmy`, `wordpress` -- not asked at all. Lemmy has communities rather
 *   than hashtags and the curated directory lists people; asking either about
 *   a tag would be asking a question their API does not have.
 *
 * A source that cannot answer is **reported**, not dropped, for the reason the
 * directory search reports one: "no server is talking about that" and "the
 * servers we asked did not reply" are different answers.
