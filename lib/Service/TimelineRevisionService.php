/**
 * A number that moves whenever a reader changes what their own timeline shows.
 *
 * The home timeline's `ETag` is built from the newest post the reader can see,
 * which answers "has anything new arrived" and nothing else. Everything else
 * that decides what the page holds is a decision the reader made — following or
 * unfollowing an account, blocking or muting one, adding a keyword filter,
 * following a hashtag — and none of those move the newest id. Without this, a
 * reader who unfollows a noisy account is answered `304` on every poll and goes
 * on seeing it until somebody else happens to post: the page they are looking
 * at is the one they just asked to change.
 *
 * So the tag carries this alongside. It is one integer per Nextcloud account,
 * incremented where the rows that decide the page are written — in the request
 * classes that own them, so it moves whether the change came from the web app,
 * a Mastodon client or the inbox, and no caller has to remember to say so.
 *
 * Reading it is one user-config lookup, which Nextcloud has usually already
 * loaded for the session; a remote actor has no Nextcloud account behind it and
 * bumping for one costs a lookup and does nothing.
 *
 * The increment is read-modify-write and deliberately not locked: two changes
 * racing may end on the same number, which loses nothing that matters — the
 * number is still different from the one before either of them, which is the
 * only thing the tag is asked.
 *
 * What it does **not** cover is a post being deleted further down a page the
 * reader already holds: the newest id does not move, this number does not move
 * for a stranger's decision, and the page is revalidated when either next
 * changes. Making a deletion reach every follower's tag means writing to every
 * follower's row, which is the fan-out this whole design exists to avoid.
