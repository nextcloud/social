/**
 * Answering a story: watching it, reacting to it, replying to it.
 *
 * A story used to be a thing that could only be watched. Pixelfed has three
 * ways of answering one and a verb for each — `View`, `Story:Reaction`,
 * `Story:Reply` — and this app sent and understood none of them, so a story
 * posted to Pixelfed followers came back silent.
 *
 * Every rule here is the same rule twice, once outbound and once inbound,
 * because Pixelfed drops what fails it without a word and so a payload that
 * would be dropped must never be built:
 *
 *  - the answer goes only to the author, never to a collection;
 *  - only somebody who **follows** the author may answer at all, which is the
 *    same condition as being able to see the story;
 *  - the author is the one person told, as with the view count;
 *  - a story that has expired takes no answers, because there is nothing left
 *    to answer.
 *
 * A reply is deliberately not a post: no `social_stream` row, no timeline, no
 * outbox, and it is deleted with the story rather than outliving it.
