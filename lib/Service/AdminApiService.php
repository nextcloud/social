/**
 * What `/api/v1/admin/*` reads and decides, over the moderation this app
 * already had.
 *
 * Nothing here is a second implementation of moderation: a decision is taken
 * by `ModerationService`, a report is resolved through `ReportService`, and
 * the instance access list is `FediverseService`'s. What this service adds is
 * the reading a moderation client does — which accounts are there, under which
 * decision, and which reports are open — because none of it existed as a query
 * anybody could ask.
 *
 * ### Why the SQL is in here
 *
 * The three reads below are the only ones in the app that ask their questions
 * (every account under a decision; a page of reports with who is handling it),
 * and they are written against `IDBConnection` in `protected` methods so the
 * policy above them can be tested without a database — the standalone suite
 * cannot even mock `IQueryBuilder`, because DBAL is not loadable in it, so a
 * test doubles these methods instead.
 *
 * ### Who counts as a moderator
 *
 * Whoever may open the Social section of the admin settings, asked of the
 * Nextcloud user behind the request: a Nextcloud administrator, or a member
 * of a group the administrator has handed that section to under
 * Administration privileges. Nextcloud's own delegation answers it
 * (`IManager::getAllowedAdminSettings()`), so this API and the panel cannot
 * disagree about who may act, and moderating no longer means administering
 * the whole server.
 *
 * An OAuth scope is not an answer to the question: this app's OAuth
 * registration accepts any scope string a client asks for, so `admin:write`
 * on a token says only that a client asked for it, never that the user behind
 * it may moderate anything.
