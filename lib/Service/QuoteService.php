 * An author's control over who quotes their posts.

 * This app has answered a `QuoteRequest` since quotes landed, but the answer
 * was derived from one thing — whether the post was public — and there was no
 * way to change it, to see who had taken you up on it, or to change your mind.
 * Mastodon 4.5 has all three, and they are the half of quoting that makes it
 * bearable: the reason to be able to quote somebody is also the reason to be
 * able to stop them.
 *
 * Three things, then: the policy (written on the post, see
 * `Stream::QUOTE_POLICIES`), the list of who has quoted it, and taking one
 * back.
