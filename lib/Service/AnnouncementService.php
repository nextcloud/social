/**
 * Mastodon's announcements: the notice an admin posts to the whole instance,
 * and the dismissal that makes it read for one account.
 *
 * Two surfaces meet here and they are not the same read. A client is answered
 * with the announcements that apply *now* — the window is a predicate of the
 * query, so nothing has to run for one to start or stop — each carrying
 * whether that account has dismissed it. The administration page is answered
 * with every announcement there is, including one that has not started and one
 * that has run out, because those are exactly the ones an admin needs to see
 * to act on.
 *
 * Dismissal is per account and stored as such: `read` is filled in from the
 * account being answered and from nothing else, so one account's read state is
 * never another's. Dismissing does not hide the announcement — Mastodon keeps
 * serving it and flips `read`, which is what lets a client show the notice
 * with its unread mark gone rather than have it vanish mid-read.
 *
 * There is no edit route. An announcement is a thing people have already read;
 * changing one under them would leave some accounts having dismissed a notice
 * that now says something else, and Mastodon's own answer to that — bumping
 * `updated_at` and leaving the dismissals — is worse than posting a new one.
 * `updated_at` is therefore always `published_at`, which is what the column
 * holds.
