 * asked for; nothing is stored, and nothing is precomputed by a cron. That
 * keeps the page honest — it cannot show a total that a deletion has already
 * made false — and it is what bounds the work: the walk stops at
 * `MAX_POSTS`, and the answer says how many posts it actually looked at so the
 * page can say so too.
 *
 * The engagement figures are per *post*, taken from the `details` each post
 * carries. That column is a JSON blob, which is why this is a walk in PHP
 * rather than a `SUM()`: the three databases this app supports do not agree on
 * how to reach inside one, and a portable aggregate would mean a column that
 * has to be kept in step with the blob.
 *
 * A remote like is included, because `details.likes` is the local count plus
 * whatever the origin reported. What no instance can know is the part of the
 * network that never told anybody, so these are a floor rather than a total —
 * which is true of every Fediverse statistic and is worth the page saying.
