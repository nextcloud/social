/**
 * The My interests feed: posts carrying the reader's hashtags, ranked.
 *
 * Built in three steps. The candidates are every post of the last few days
 * that carries one of the reader's interests and that they may see — the same
 * visibility, blocks, mutes and silences as the hashtag timeline, less their
 * own posts, the posts they said "less like this" about, and anything not in
 * their languages. Each is ranked by how well it matches, halved for every day
 * of its age. Then the page is spread out: no author more than twice in any
 * twenty, no one hashtag more than two fifths of them, and one post in ten
 * from a hashtag that often travels with the reader's own but is not on their
 * list yet.
 *
 * A ranked feed cannot be paged by id the way a timeline is, because the next
 * page is not "older than the last post". So the ranking is made once, kept
 * for an hour, and cut into pages; a client that pages with the last post's
 * id as `max_id`, as every Mastodon client does, gets the page after that
 * post in the ranking. Refreshing — a request with no cursor — ranks afresh.
