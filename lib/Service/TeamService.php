/**
 * An account a team posts from.
 *
 * Pixelfed's answer to "several people, one voice" is its `Group*` family:
 * twenty models, still in beta, and a second social graph beside the one it
 * already has. Nextcloud's answer is the one it has had all along — a group of
 * people who already work together — and this is that group given an account.
 * It is the one thing in this comparison that Nextcloud can do and Pixelfed
 * cannot, because Pixelfed has no idea who works with whom.
 *
 * A team account is **an actor like any other**. That is the whole design: it
 * has a key pair, a followers collection, an inbox and an outbox, it can be
 * followed from Mastodon and Pixelfed, it can be moderated, it can be
 * suspended, and none of that needed writing again. What is new is only who is
 * allowed to speak as it.
 *
 * **The membership is the Nextcloud group, live.** No membership is copied
 * here, deliberately: a copy of a group is a copy that drifts, and the drift
 * is somebody who left the organisation still able to post as it. Every check
 * asks the group manager at the moment somebody tries.
 *
 * **Who wrote a post is recorded, and shown inside the team.** Outside it the
 * team speaks with one voice, which is the point of having one; inside it,
 * somebody has to be able to find out which of them wrote the thing everybody
 * is now talking about. A moderator sees it too — a report about a team
 * account is otherwise a report about nobody.
