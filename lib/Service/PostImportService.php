/**
 * Bringing an account's own posts over from the server it wrote them on.
 *
 * What moving to another Fediverse server has never carried is the posts. A
 * `Move` takes the followers; an export takes a file. This reads that file and
 * writes the posts here — as **new local posts of the importing account**,
 * dated when they were written, with their pictures.
 *
 * Three rules decide everything else, and each of them is load-bearing:
 *
 * **Nothing is federated.** Not one delivery is queued. Re-publishing somebody's
 * five years of posts would put five years of posts into the timeline of every
 * person who follows them, on every server, in one afternoon. The rows are
 * written and the queue is never touched — the same write-the-row,
 * federate-nothing discipline `SocialMigrator::importRelations()` uses for the
 * follow graph.
 *
 * **The ids are ours.** A post's id belongs to the server it was written on: an
 * id from somewhere else served from here would be a second server claiming
 * another's URI, and nothing would resolve it. So each post is minted locally
 * and the original id is remembered in `social_import_post` — which is what
 * makes a second run of the same archive a no-op, and what lets a reply find
 * the post it answers.
 *
 * **Only what the account wrote.** Boosts are somebody else's post and are
 * skipped. Direct messages are skipped too: their recipients are accounts on
 * the old server, and a direct message with nobody in it is a post nobody —
 * the author included — can find.
 *
 * Four shapes are read, because four are what the networks hand out:
 *
 *  - this app's own archive (`social/outbox.json` in the zip, with the files
 *    under `media_attachments/`),
 *  - Mastodon's and GoToSocial's (`outbox.json` at the root of the zip, same
 *    layout — theirs is the layout ours copied),
 *  - an `outbox.json` on its own, and
 *  - Pixelfed's `pixelfed-statuses.json`, which is its API's shape and carries
 *    **URLs rather than files**: those pictures are fetched from the old
 *    server, which therefore has to still be running.
 *
 * And a fifth that *is* a Fediverse export but is not a timeline: **PeerTube's**
 * (`/api/v1/users/me/exports`), read from `peertube/videos.json`. Its own JSON
 * rather than the `activity-pub/outbox.json` sitting beside it, because the
 * ActivityPub half names each video's file by its address on the old server
 * while the PeerTube half names the copy that is **inside the archive** — so
 * one import needs the old server to still be running and the other does not.
 * It also states the privacy as a number rather than leaving it to be read out
 * of an audience, and carries the title, the tags, the category and the
 * licence, which is most of what a video is.
 *
 * And a sixth that is not a Fediverse export at all: **Instagram's** "Download
 * your information" archive, which is the way most people arrive at Pixelfed.
 * It is read from `content/posts_*.json` and the reels beside them, with the
 * pictures out of the archive's own `media/` folder — nothing is fetched,
 * because there is no server left that would answer us for them.
 *
 * Instagram's archive is missing three things every other export has, and each
 * is answered rather than guessed at:
 *
 *  - **No ids.** One is derived from the file a post carries and the moment it
 *    was posted, so a second run of the same archive is still a no-op.
 *  - **No visibility.** An Instagram post was visible to whoever could see the
 *    account, which is not a sentence this app can translate. The importing
 *    account's **own default** is used — what their next post would get — and
 *    the person is told that is what happened.
 *  - **No hashtags as data.** They are words in the caption, so they are read
 *    out of it, which is what makes them findable here.
 *
 * Only the JSON export can be read. Instagram also offers HTML, which is a
 * rendering of the same data with the data taken out.

	 *   `SearchService::resolveStatus()` requires, so a redirect cannot

	 *
	 * What it cannot check is whether the video is **yours**. Neither can
