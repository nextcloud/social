/**
 * When each of this app's background jobs last ran, and whether that is late.
 *
 * Almost everything this app does away from a request is a cron job: posts go
 * out, stories expire, media is swept, videos are transcoded, the storage
 * figures are taken. When cron stops — a broken system timer, a
 * `cron.php` that has been failing since an upgrade — nothing in the app says
 * so. The symptom is a post that never arrives and a disk that never shrinks,
 * and the only diagnostic was `occ social:check:install`, which an
 * administrator runs after they already suspect something.
 *
 * Read from Nextcloud's own job list rather than from anything this app keeps:
 * `last_run` is what the scheduler itself writes, so it cannot drift from what
 * actually happened, and a job that was never registered — an app upgraded
 * without its migrations having run — is visibly absent rather than silently
 * zero.
 *
 * **Late is a judgement, not a failure.** A job whose interval is twelve
 * minutes and which last ran twenty minutes ago is normal on an instance whose
 * cron runs every quarter of an hour; one that last ran a day ago is not. The
 * threshold is the job's own interval times a factor, which is the only shape
 * that works when the intervals in one app run from five minutes to a day.
