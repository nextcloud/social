/**
 * The same video written at two or three sizes, as HLS.
 *
 * `VideoTranscodeService` makes a video *playable* — one H.264 MP4 that every
 * server and browser will take. This makes it *watchable on a phone on a
 * train*: a ladder of heights plus a playlist that lets the player move
 * between them as the connection changes. It is also what PeerTube publishes,
 * so a video laddered here is a video a PeerTube reader gets the same way they
 * get a native one.
 *
 * **One file per rung.** HLS normally means a directory of a few hundred
 * segments; `-hls_flags single_file` writes each rung as a single fragmented
 * MP4 and addresses the segments inside it as byte ranges. The store keeps
 * doing the one thing it does well — a file per row — and a 40-minute video is
 * three files rather than a thousand. It is also, not by coincidence, exactly
 * the shape PeerTube's own fMP4 output has.
 *
 * **Keyframes are forced onto the segment boundary** at every rung, with the
 * same period. Without that, ffmpeg cuts a segment at the next keyframe it
 * happens to find, the rungs end up with different boundaries, and a player
 * switching between them either stalls or skips. With it, every rung's
 * segment *n* covers the same seconds of the video, which is the whole
 * premise of adaptive streaming.
 *
 * **It never upscales.** A rung taller than the source is dropped rather than
 * encoded: a 480p video written out at 1080p is a bigger file of exactly the
 * same picture, and a ladder whose top rung is the worst deal on it is worse
 * than no ladder.
 *
 * Off unless an administrator turns it on, like the transcoder and for the
 * same reasons — this is ffmpeg time on somebody's server, several times over
 * per video.
