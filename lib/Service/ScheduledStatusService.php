/**
 * Posts a client asked to have published later, and the publishing of them.
 *
 * `POST /api/v1/statuses` with a `scheduled_at` is not a post: Mastodon answers
 * it with a ScheduledStatus entity, publishes nothing, and hands the request
 * back to a worker when the time comes. This app used to parse the field and
 * post immediately, so a client that scheduled something for next Tuesday
 * showed its user a success and had already published it.
 *
 * The whole request is kept, not a rendered post, because publishing has to
 * take the same path an immediate post takes — `PostService::createPost()`,
 * over a `Post` built exactly as `ApiController::statusNew()` builds one. A
 * rendered note stored now would be built by one code path and federated by
 * another, and the two would drift: the quote approval, the language fallback
 * and the source snapshot all happen inside `createPost()`.
