/**
 * Everything one account leaves behind, in one list.
 *
 * There were two of these lists — one in `PersonInterface::delete()` for an
 * account that is gone, one in `ModerationService::purgeActor()` for one a
 * moderator has suspended — and they had drifted in both directions: a
 * suspended account went on holding likes and boosts that counted on other
 * people's posts, on filing reports and on being named in other people's
 * pictures, while a deleted one left its domain blocks, its notes, its albums,
 * its stories and half a dozen newer tables behind. The rule is the one the
 * older comment already stated and could not enforce: whichever list was
 * forgotten is the row that outlives the account.
 *
 * So there is one list, and a table added tomorrow has one place to be
 * registered. The posts themselves are not in it: a deletion rewrites what
 * addressed the account and may have to finish in a job (see
 * `PersonInterface::deleteStreamFromActor()`), which a suspension does not do,
 * and that is the only part of the two paths that legitimately differs.
 *
 * Every step is caught on its own and none depends on an earlier one, so
 * running it twice on the same account is a no-op rather than a failure, and
 * one table that cannot be written does not leave the rest behind.
