/**
 * Passing a local report on to the instance the reported account is on.
 *
 * `POST /api/v1/reports` takes `forward`, and a user who ticks it is asking
 * for the one thing this instance cannot do for them: act on an account it
 * does not host. Without this, ticking the box did nothing at all and the
 * report stopped at our own moderators — the remote instance, the only one
 * that can suspend the account, was never told.
 *
 * **Who signs it.** The instance, never the reporter. The `Flag` names this
 * server's own actor and is signed with its key, so the receiving moderators
 * see "cloud.example reported this" and not the account that filed it. That is
 * Mastodon's behaviour and the reason for it is the whole point: the person
 * is reporting an account on that very instance, whose admins may be hostile
 * to them, and a report that carried their handle would hand those admins a
 * name to retaliate against. The comment is passed on as written — the user is
 * told the report is being forwarded, and can keep it to our moderators by not
 * ticking the box.
 *
 * **Delivery.** Sent inline rather than through `social_request_queue`, and
 * this is the one thing here that is a compromise: a queued delivery is signed
 * by `HttpSignatureService::signDelivery()`, which resolves the signing key
 * from `oc_social_actor` by the queue row's author — and the instance actor is
 * deliberately not a row there (see `InstanceActorService`). So the one
 * activity that must be signed as the server is the one the queue cannot sign,
 * and it goes out inline with `HttpSignatureService::signAsInstance()`. One
 * report is one POST with a short timeout, it never blocks storing the report,
 * and a failure costs the forward and nothing else.
