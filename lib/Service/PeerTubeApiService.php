/**
 * This app's posts, accounts and channels in the shapes PeerTube's own clients
 * read.
 *
 * The same move the Pixelfed routes are: a client that already exists, pointed
 * at this instance, is worth more than a client nobody has written. PeerTube's
 * API is not Mastodon's — different names, different ids, a different idea of
 * what a video is — so this is a translation layer and not an alias, and it
 * lives in one file for the same reason `PixelfedController` does: somebody
 * should be able to read the whole of what one client is promised in one place.
 *
 * **Ids.** PeerTube addresses a video by an integer and by a uuid. The integer
 * here is the post's `nid`, which is what this app's own API gives a client;
 * the uuid is the one `PeerTubeService::uuidFor()` already mints and already
 * publishes on the wire, so a video seen through this API and the same video
 * seen over ActivityPub carry the same uuid rather than two that nothing can
 * tell apart. `shortUUID` is that uuid again: PeerTube's short form is its own
 * base-62 encoding, and a made-up one would be a key that resolves nowhere.
 *
 * **What it does not do.** Nothing here writes. PeerTube's upload is a
 * resumable protocol with a transcoding state machine behind it, and a
 * half-built one that accepted a file and lost it would be worse than none.
 * Comments are read and not posted, for the same reason a client posting
 * through this route would bypass the review queue the composer goes through.
