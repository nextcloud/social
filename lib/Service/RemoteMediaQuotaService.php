/**
 * How much of this instance's disk one other server may occupy.
 *
 * Every picture on a post somebody here follows is fetched and kept, and
 * nothing bounded that by where it came from: one server posting large images
 * at a high rate fills the disk of every instance that follows anybody on it,
 * and the retention sweep only catches up a day at a time and only for posts
 * old enough. An administrator found out from the disk.
 *
 * **Measured on a schedule, spent in the moment.** Walking the store to total
 * a domain's bytes is a `stat` per file and cannot happen on a fetch, so the
 * quota is read from the figure `MediaUsageService` takes on the cron, plus
 * what this instance has cached from that domain since. The stored figure is
 * up to a day old and the counter covers the day: together they are close
 * enough for a disk quota, and wrong in the direction of refusing early rather
 * than late.
 *
 * Without a memcache there is nothing to count the day in, so only the daily
 * figure applies — the quota still holds, a day at a time. **Off by default**:
 * an instance that has been federating for a year and acquires a quota on
 * upgrade would start refusing the pictures of the servers it talks to most,
 * which is not an upgrade note anybody reads in time.
