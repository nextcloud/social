/**
 * The arithmetic of For you, and nothing else.
 *
 * No database, no clock of its own and no configuration read behind the
 * caller's back: every number it needs is handed to it, so every rule the
 * feature has can be tested as a rule. `InterestService` does the reading and
 * the writing around it; `InterestFeedService` uses the weights to rank posts.
 *
 * The rules, in the order a signal meets them:
 *
 *  - Passive time on screen is neutral. Only a Shorts player's measured
 *    playback ratio, explicit actions and skips can teach the profile.
 *  - **A post's signal is split** evenly across its hashtags, so a post with
 *    ten tags teaches ten tags a little rather than each of them a lot; past
 *    fifteen it is tag spam and teaches nothing.
 *  - **Scores decay** with a half-life, worked out when a score is read rather
 *    than by a job that rewrites every row, so what someone was into last
 *    spring does not run their feed today.
 *  - **The list** is followed tags and automatically learned tags above the
 *    threshold, ranked by score and limited to the cap. Legacy manual and
 *    pinned rows are ignored so old reader choices no longer steer the feed.
