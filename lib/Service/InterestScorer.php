/**
 * The arithmetic of My interests, and nothing else.
 *
 * No database, no clock of its own and no configuration read behind the
 * caller's back: every number it needs is handed to it, so every rule the
 * feature has can be tested as a rule. `InterestService` does the reading and
 * the writing around it; `InterestFeedService` uses the weights to rank posts.
 *
 * The rules, in the order a signal meets them:
 *
 *  - **What a look is worth** is decided against the reader's own habits, not
 *    a stopwatch: the time a post would take to read at an ordinary pace is
 *    worked out from its length and its pictures, and the ratio of the actual
 *    time to that is compared with the ratio this reader usually shows. A fast
 *    reader and a slow one both linger on what interests them — at different
 *    speeds.
 *  - **A post's signal is split** evenly across its hashtags, so a post with
 *    ten tags teaches ten tags a little rather than each of them a lot; past
 *    fifteen it is tag spam and teaches nothing.
 *  - **Scores decay** with a half-life, worked out when a score is read rather
 *    than by a job that rewrites every row, so what someone was into last
 *    spring does not run their feed today.
 *  - **The list** is every pinned tag at the rank it was pinned to, and the
 *    rest — manual, followed and learned tags above the threshold — filling
 *    the free ranks by score, up to the cap.
