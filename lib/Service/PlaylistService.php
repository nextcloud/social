/**
 * PeerTube's playlists, as this app's collections.
 *
 * They are the same thing: an ordered set of somebody's own posts, with a
 * title, a description and a visibility. PeerTube users organise everything
 * this way — a series, a course, "watch later" — and a channel's playlists are
 * half of what its page shows, so a Nextcloud that ingested the videos and
 * none of the playlists showed a channel's work as an undifferentiated pile.
 *
 * **Read-only, and deliberately.** A playlist that arrived from somewhere else
 * is somebody else's document: it is stored so it can be shown and it is
 * rebuilt from the wire whenever it changes there, and nothing here may add to
 * it or take from it. The one that goes *out* is the other direction — a
 * collection of ours, published as a `Playlist` on the channel that owns it.
 *
 * Only videos this instance already holds are put in one. A playlist naming
 * forty videos nobody here has ever seen is not a reason to fetch forty videos:
 * what arrives by following the channel is what the playlist shows, and it
 * fills in as the rest arrives.
