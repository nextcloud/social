/**
 * Who the people you follow follow — the "Followgraph" question.
 *
 * `SuggestionService` asks the same question of this instance's own database,
 * and on a small server the answer is nearly empty: the follows it holds are
 * the ones that happened here. This asks the *other servers* instead. For each
 * account the viewer follows, their `following` collection is fetched from
 * wherever they live, and an account named by several of them is a better
 * suggestion than an account named by one. That is the whole model: a count of
 * who vouched, and the names of the ones who did.
 *
 * It is worth being clear about what this reads. A `following` collection is
 * published by the server that owns the account, to whoever asks, and many
 * servers do not publish it at all — Mastodon has a "hide your social graph"
 * setting and honours it here by answering with an empty collection or a 403.
 * A viewer's own follows are never sent anywhere: what leaves this instance is
 * a request for a public collection, one per account followed, which is the
 * same request their server answers for anyone.
 *
 * **It needs a starting handful of follows and says so.** Following nobody
 * means there is no graph to walk, and a page that answers that with "no
 * suggestions" has told the reader they are uninteresting rather than that
 * they have not started. `MINIMUM_FOLLOWS` is where it starts trying, and
 * below it the answer carries `needs` so the page can say what to do instead.
