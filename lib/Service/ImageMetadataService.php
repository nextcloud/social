/**
 * Removes the metadata a camera writes into a picture, before the picture is
 * stored or federated.
 *
 * A photo off a phone carries an Exif block, and that block routinely carries
 * the coordinates the photo was taken at. Until this existed the app wrote the
 * uploaded bytes through untouched and served them as the attachment's `url`,
 * so posting a picture published where it was taken to every follower and every
 * peer that mirrors it. Nothing warned anybody, and nothing could be undone
 * afterwards -- the copies are already out.
 *
 * The work is done on the container, not on the pixels. Re-encoding a JPEG to
 * launder it costs a generation of quality on every upload and would make the
 * app the reason people's pictures look worse than they did on their phone; the
 * metadata lives in identifiable, skippable segments, so it is cheaper and
 * lossless to walk the file and not copy them. Three formats are handled that
 * way (JPEG, PNG, WebP). The one case that cannot be lossless is an Exif
 * `Orientation` other than "upright": the tag is the only record that the
 * picture is meant to be rotated, so dropping it silently turns every portrait
 * photo on its side. There the caller is told to rotate, which means a re-encode
 * -- see `orientation()`.
 *
 * What is deliberately kept: the ICC colour profile (dropping it shifts colour
 * on a wide-gamut photo), and everything structural -- animation, transparency,
 * the palette. What goes: Exif in all its spellings, XMP, IPTC/Photoshop
 * resources, JPEG comments, PNG text chunks and timestamps.
