/**
 * Looking for somebody to follow, in directories other servers publish.
 *
 * The app could already find a person whose full handle you had already been
 * told, and suggest people out of a follow graph that a new account has none
 * of. Neither is how anybody actually finds anyone: you know a name, or a
 * subject, and not which of forty thousand servers they are on. What was
 * missing was somewhere to *ask*.
 *
 * So this asks several servers at once. Every API it uses is one those servers
 * serve to anybody without a token, because a directory is the part of a
 * server that exists to be read by strangers — nothing here holds credentials
 * for anyone else's instance, and nothing here can be made to.
 *
 * **What it does not do is aggregate.** No list is stored, nothing is indexed,
 * and an answer is kept for five minutes so that typing does not hammer four
 * servers per keystroke. The people in it are not this instance's to hold, and
 * a copy would be a directory nobody agreed to be in. What *is* stored is
 * about servers, not people: which ones a directory of servers lists and what
 * software each peer runs, written by `refresh()` from `Cron\Cache` so that
 * listing the sources never waits on a remote host.
 *
 * The kinds it can ask:
 *
 * - `local` — this instance's own directory and its cached actors. Always
 *   first, always present, never a network request.
 * - `mastodon` — `/api/v1/directory` and `/api/v1/accounts/lookup`, which is
 *   also what Pixelfed, Hometown, Glitch and most forks serve.
 * - `misskey` — `users/search`.
 * - `lemmy` — `search` with `type_=Users`.
 *
 * Mastodon has no public *search*, and that is a fact about Mastodon rather
 * than an omission here: `/api/v2/search` needs a token. What it does have is
 * an exact-handle lookup and a directory page, so a Mastodon-kind source is
 * asked both — the lookup answers "is there a `nextcloud` on that server",
 * the directory page answers "who is active there", and the query filters the
 * second. That is weaker than search and is reported as what it is, rather
 * than dressed up: see `DirectoryResults::isExhaustive()`.
 *
 * @see DirectorySource for why the kind is configured rather than sniffed
