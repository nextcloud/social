/**
 * The instance's own library of animated pictures.
 *
 * **Why this rather than Giphy or Tenor.** Those are the obvious way to get a
 * GIF picker, and both mean every composer on the instance talking to a third
 * party: the search terms people type are sent there, and every thumbnail is a
 * request from the reader's browser to a host the instance does not control.
 * That is a decision about a company's internal feed that this app is not
 * entitled to make on an administrator's behalf, and a setting to turn it on
 * would still be a setting that quietly sends what people are looking for to
 * somebody else's server.
 *
 * **Why not just Files.** The composer can already attach any file, this one
 * included. What this adds is a *shared* set: a picture an administrator put
 * here is in everybody's picker, under a name they can search for, without
 * anybody having to be given a folder or remember a path. That is what makes
 * it the same joke in the same team rather than one person's collection.
 *
 * Stored the way custom emoji are — a row and a file in appdata — because it
 * is the same shape of thing: a small curated set, served to everybody, which
 * must not break because a file moved in somebody's Files.
