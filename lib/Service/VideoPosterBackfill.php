/**
 * Poster frames for the stored videos that have none, a few at a time.
 *
 * A video uploaded here is given its poster on the way in
 * (`CacheDocumentService`); one stored before that existed, or while the
 * server had no ffmpeg, has none, and a card of it on the Videos page is a
 * black rectangle. `Cron\VideoPosters` calls this every run until it has been
 * through them all, so nobody has to know that `occ social:media:posters`
 * exists — the command is still there for doing it all at once.
 *
 * It walks the videos in nid order from a cursor in the app settings
 * (`poster_backfill_cursor`), so a video it could not take a frame from is
 * tried once and left behind rather than retried every run. Nothing is
 * walked while the server has no ffmpeg: the cursor waits there, and the
 * videos are done once an administrator installs it.
 *
 * The poster is the same frame, JPEG and `resized_copy` an upload gets
 * (`CacheDocumentService::generatePoster()`, which takes no metadata from the
 * file), and only the posts that carry each video are rewritten to show it.
