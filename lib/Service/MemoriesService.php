/**
 * The reader looking back at their own posting: what they wrote on this day in
 * years gone by, and how the last week went.
 *
 * An internal social feed is a company's memory, and almost all of it is
 * unreachable the moment it scrolls off the timeline: a post is found again
 * only by somebody who remembers enough of it to search for it. `onThisDay()`
 * is the one view that surfaces old posts without being asked — the same day,
 * a year or more ago. `recap()` is the other direction, the week just gone,
 * and it is off until the reader asks for it.
 *
 * **Only ever the caller's own posts.** Not a privacy convenience but the
 * whole design: because it is the reader's own, it can include their
 * followers-only and direct posts without asking who is allowed to see what.
 * The controller must pass the viewer's own actor and nothing else, and the
 * query it uses does not filter by audience.
 *
 * **Anniversaries, not a window.** A post from "about a year ago" is not a
 * memory, it is a random old post. Each year back is looked up as its own
 * calendar day in the reader's own timezone, so the 4th of March finds the 4th
 * of March and a post written at 23:50 does not belong to the next day.
