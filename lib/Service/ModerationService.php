/**

 *
 * The reports panel could describe a problem and do nothing about it: resolve
 * marked the complaint handled and left the account exactly as it was. These
 * are the two decisions a moderator actually needs, plus the ability to take
 * one post down.
 *
 * Silencing is reversible and touches nothing: the account stays reachable for
 * the people who chose to follow it, and leaves the public and global
 * timelines. Suspending removes what the account has posted here and refuses
 * what it sends next, so it is the one that needs care — and it is why the
 * decision is recorded rather than only applied. Lifting a suspension stops
 * the refusal; it does not bring back what was deleted, and the confirmation
 * in the admin panel says so.
