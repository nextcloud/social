/**
 * Mastodon 4.3's notification policy and the requests inbox it fills.
 *
 * What it is for: an account that is mentioned by strangers can either read
 * every notification or turn notifications off. The policy is the third
 * answer — notifications from accounts the reader has no relationship with are
 * *held* rather than shown or lost, gathered per sender, and the reader
 * decides about the sender once.
 *
 * Nothing is held by default. Every one of the five questions starts at
 * `accept`, which is exactly what every account had before this existed: a
 * policy that began by holding things back would swallow notifications for
 * accounts that never asked it to.
 *
 * Held, not deleted. `drop` is Mastodon's third answer and this app treats it
 * as `filter` at read time for one reason: the notification row is written by
 * the inbox, long before anybody reads it, and dropping it there would mean
 * the policy decides what is *stored* — so a policy loosened on Tuesday could
 * not show what was refused on Monday. The reader sees the same thing either
 * way; what differs is whether the decision can be taken back.
 *
 * Reading is where the policy applies, not writing, and that has a cost worth
 * naming: `/api/v1/notifications` reads a page and then removes what is held,
 * so a page can come back short. It is the same trade `FilterService` makes,
 * and the paging cursor is taken from what the query returned rather than from
 * what survived, so a shortened page never ends the client's paging early.
