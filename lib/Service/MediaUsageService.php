 * How much disk this app is using, and on whose behalf.

 * An administrator finds out that Social is filling the disk from the disk.
 * There is nothing in the app that says how much of it is this instance's own
 * uploads — which are somebody's posts and are not going anywhere — and how
 * much is the cached copies of other servers' pictures, which the retention
 * sweep exists to remove.
 *
 * **Measured on a schedule, never on page load.** The only honest number here
 * is the size of the files, and that is a `stat` per file: tens of thousands
 * of them on an instance that has been federating for a year. So the walk
 * happens in the cron, the answer is written to app config with the moment it
 * was taken, and the administration page reads that and says when it was
 * measured. A number that is a day old and cheap is worth more than one that
 * is exact and makes the settings page take a minute to open.
 *
 * The walk itself was `occ social:media:usage`, which is now this class with a
 * command and a cron job on top of it.
