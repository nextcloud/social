 * the camera wrote into it.
 *
 * Two formats arrive that a browser cannot draw. HEIC is the default on an
 * iPhone, so refusing it -- which is what the app did -- meant a large share of
 * the people this is for could not post a photo at all without converting it
 * first. It has to be transcoded. AVIF a browser *can* draw, so it is kept as
 * AVIF and only rewritten if it actually carries metadata.
 *
 * The order of preference throughout is "do nothing": a JPEG that is upright and
 * carries no Exif is stored byte for byte as it was uploaded. Re-encoding costs
 * a generation of quality every time and the app should not be the reason
 * somebody's photos look worse here than on their phone. So the expensive path
 * is taken only when something actually requires it -- a format nothing can
 * draw, an orientation tag that is about to be dropped, or metadata in a
 * container this cannot edit in place.
 *
 * @see ImageMetadataService for the lossless path
