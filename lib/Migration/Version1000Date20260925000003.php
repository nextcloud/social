/**
 * `social_host_breaker`: which peers delivery is leaving alone, and until when.
 *
 * The circuit breaker lived in the distributed cache, which is a `NullCache`
 * on an instance without a memcache — so there it held nothing, every pass
 * rediscovered every dead peer one thirty-second timeout at a time, and the
 * cron's whole budget went on servers that were known to be gone. A row per
 * failing host is what every delivery path can read whatever the server has
 * configured.
 *
 * A file of its own for the reason `Version1000Date20260924000001` gives: the
 * squash is recorded as run on every instance that has upgraded, so a table
 * added to it would exist only on fresh installs.
