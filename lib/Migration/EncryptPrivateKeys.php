/**
 * Rewrites the actor private keys stored as bare PEM into their encrypted
 * form. New keys are written encrypted from the start; this step only exists
 * for rows created before that.
 *
 * The marker is what keeps it affordable. "A no-op once no plaintext key is
 * left" was true of the writes and false of the read: the LIKE scan of
 * social_actor ran on every `occ upgrade` for the life of the instance, with
 * the instance in maintenance mode, to discover there was nothing to do. It is
 * only set once a run finishes with nothing left behind, so a row that could
 * not be encrypted is still retried on the next upgrade.
 *
 * A row that cannot be encrypted is reported and left alone rather than
 * allowed to end the upgrade: the plaintext form is still readable, so the
 * actor keeps working and the next upgrade tries again.
