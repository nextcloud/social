/**
 * `social_cache_actor.account_lower`: the handle, lowercased, and indexed.
 *
 * The account search behind the composer's mention picker, `/api/v2/search`,
 * `/api/v1/accounts/search` and the unified search matched a prefix of
 * `account` case-insensitively — on MySQL by comparing it `COLLATE
 * utf8mb4_general_ci` — and the lookup of one account by its handle compared
 * `LOWER(account)`. `account` has no index, and neither comparison could have
 * used one: every keystroke was a scan of every cached actor. The lowercased
 * copy is compared as it stands (see `CacheActorsRequest::searchAccounts()`).
 *
 * Like `host`, it is derived from the handle, and written wherever the handle
 * is. A file of its own rather than lines in the squash, which every instance
 * that has upgraded has already recorded as run.
