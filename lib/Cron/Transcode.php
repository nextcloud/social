/**
 * Turning stored videos into the one format the rest of the network plays.
 *
 * A job of its own rather than a step of `Cron\Cache`, for one reason: that
 * job budgets five minutes for eleven steps that each do a little, and
 * converting one video can take longer than the whole budget. A step that
 * regularly overran would starve every step behind it.
 *
 * **One video per run.** The job is not trying to drain a backlog quickly; it
 * is trying never to be the reason a server's cron is slow. A hundred videos
 * are a day's work at this rate, which is the right speed for something that
 * makes old uploads travel better and is not urgent for any of them.
 *
 * Off unless an administrator turned it on. Re-encoding is lossy and it is
 * somebody's file.
