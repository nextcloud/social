/**
 * Moves whose job died — the worker was killed, the server restarted —
 * while they ran. Core drops a queued job before it runs it, so nothing
 * else would ever end such a move, and it would hold the account for good:
 * "Try again" waits for a failed move, a new one for none under way.
 *
 * A move counts as stopped when it is `running`, has not been written to
 * for AFTER — a running move writes as it copies, blob by blob and page by
 * page of follows and posts — no job for it waits in the queue, and no
 * job holds its lock (Cron\AtprotoMove::lockOf()). It is queued
 * again RESUMES times (`progress.resumed`, forgotten when the person goes
 * on with it), then fails with `move-interrupted`, so the person can try
 * again or call it off. A move away that stopped while the DID was handed
 * over is first asked of the directory: once the DID points at the other
 * server, the move goes on from the activation, and can no longer be
 * called off. A move here that stopped at the follows or the posts, which
 * come once the account is active here and are best effort, is done; one
 * driven by a tool waits for the person's decision again before then.
