/**
 * Mastodon's announcements: the instance-wide notice an admin posts and every
 * account is shown once.
 *
 * Two surfaces, one subsystem, and they are not authenticated the same way.
 *
 * The two client routes are `#[PublicPage]` with `#[NoCSRFRequired]`, like
 * `ApiController` and `ListController`, and for the same reason: a Mastodon
 * client authenticates with a bearer token and has no Nextcloud session or
 * CSRF token to present, so `#[NoAdminRequired]` would refuse every real
 * caller before the handler ran. Both then require a viewer themselves — no
 * token, no session, 401 — so nothing is public in fact.
 *
 * The three `admin*` routes carry no attribute at all, which in Nextcloud
 * means an admin session and a CSRF token, as every route of
 * `ModerationController` does. They are the administration page's, never part
 * of the client API, and they are here rather than in that controller because
 * they read and write the same table as the routes above them: an admin
 * surface that drifted from the client entity is how an announcement gets
 * posted that nobody is served.
