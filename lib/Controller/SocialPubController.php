/**
 * The browser half of the `/@{username}` routes.
 *
 * `ActivityPubController` owns those urls and answers ActivityPub clients
 * itself; a request whose `Accept` header asks for HTML is handed here. Who is
 * asking decides what they get: a reader with a session gets the app, the same
 * page `NavigationController::navigate()` serves at `/`, since the client-side
 * router has a view for every one of these paths — a profile, its followers, a
 * post. Everybody else gets the public page, which has no navigation and no
 * reply box. This used to serve the public page to everybody, so a link to a
 * post or a profile landed a logged-in reader on a page with a "Get your own
 * free account" banner and a Follow button that started the remote-follow flow
 * for an account they could have followed with one click.
