/**
 * The client API's media half: putting a file on this server, and serving it
 * back.
 *
 * It is almost the only part of the client API that does not answer JSON.
 * These routes hand over bytes — an image, a range of a video, an HLS playlist
 * built on the spot, one rung of a ladder of transcodes — which is a different
 * job from the rest of ApiController with a different set of things to get
 * right: what media type to declare, what a browser with `nosniff` will do
 * with it, how large a file may be, and which copy of a document a uuid names.
 *
 * A trait and not a controller of its own, deliberately. A separate controller
 * would change every one of these route names, and `social.Api.mediaOpen` is
 * written into the ActivityPub documents this server publishes and into the
 * URLs its own pages generate — it is in eighteen places, and one missed is a
 * broken picture on a page nobody thought to open. What this separates is the
 * file; the controller is the same controller, with the same routes, the same
 * session handling and the same injected services.
