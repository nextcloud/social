/**
 * What one account decides about another, beside following, blocking and
 * muting it: the instances it will not hear from, the note it keeps about an
 * account, and the accounts it features on its profile.
 *
 * They share a controller because they share an access model, and it is the
 * strictest one in this API: every row involved belongs to exactly one account,
 * is only ever read for that account, and is never federated. Nobody — not the
 * account a note is about, not the instance that was blocked — may see any of
 * it, so every route here resolves the viewer first and scopes every read and
 * every write by them.
 *
 * Not `RelationshipService`, which is blocks and mutes and does federate what
 * Mastodon federates. Nothing here leaves the server.
 *
 * `#[PublicPage]` with `#[NoCSRFRequired]`, like `ApiController`,
 * `TagController` and `ListController`, and for the same reason: a Mastodon
 * client authenticates with a bearer token and has no Nextcloud session or CSRF
 * token to present, so `#[NoAdminRequired]` would refuse every real caller
 * before the handler ran. Every route then requires a viewer itself — no token,
 * no session, 401 — so nothing is public in fact.
