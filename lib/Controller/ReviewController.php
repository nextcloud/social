/**
 * An author's own posts that are waiting for a moderator.
 *
 * The one thing this feature must not do is lose somebody's writing without
 * telling them. The composer says a post was held at the moment it happens,
 * but a person who closed the tab has to be able to find it again — so these
 * two routes exist: what of mine is waiting, and take that one back.
 *
 * Session routes, like the migration ones and for the same reason: unpublished
 * text of the caller's own is not something a third-party token should be able
 * to read, and there is no account parameter here, so there is nothing to
 * point at anybody else. What may be read is scoped in SQL on the way out
 * (`PostHoldsRequest`), not checked afterwards.
