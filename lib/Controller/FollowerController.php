/**
 * Removing somebody from your own followers, which is not blocking them.
 *
 * Mastodon's `POST /api/v1/accounts/{id}/remove_from_followers` ends one
 * direction of a relationship: the account stops receiving the viewer's posts
 * and is told so, while everything else — whether the viewer follows *them*,
 * whether either has blocked the other — is left exactly as it was. A block
 * would do this too and a great deal more, and would be visible to the other
 * side as a block.
 *
 * The activity that says so is a `Reject{Follow}`, which is what this app
 * already sends when a pending follow request is refused: to the other server,
 * a follow that is rejected and a follow that is withdrawn after being
 * accepted are the same statement — "this follow is not in force". So this
 * route is `FollowService::rejectFollowRequest()` applied to an accepted row
 * rather than a pending one, and there is one federating path for both.
 *
 * A route of its own rather than another method on `ApiController` for the
 * reason `ListController` and `TagController` are their own controllers: it
 * names the granular scope it needs, where `ApiController`'s routes require
 * the broad one.
 *
 * `#[PublicPage]` with `#[NoCSRFRequired]`, like `ApiController`: a Mastodon
 * client authenticates with a bearer token and has no Nextcloud session or
 * CSRF token to present. The route requires a viewer itself, so nothing is
 * public in fact.
