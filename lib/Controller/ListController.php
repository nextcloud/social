 *

 * access model — there is no sharing, no visibility flag and nobody else who
 * may read one. Every route here therefore resolves its list through
 * `ListsRequest::getOwnedById()`, which carries the owner in the statement, so
 * a list belonging to somebody else is a 404 and not a row that was read and
 * then rejected.
 *
 * `#[PublicPage]` with `#[NoCSRFRequired]`, like `ApiController` and
 * `TagController`, and for the same reason: a Mastodon client authenticates
 * with a bearer token and has no Nextcloud session or CSRF token to present,
 * so `#[NoAdminRequired]` would refuse every real caller before the handler
 * ran. Every route here then requires a viewer itself — no token, no session,
 * 401 — so nothing is public in fact.
