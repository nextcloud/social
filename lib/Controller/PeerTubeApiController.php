/**
 * The routes PeerTube's own clients ask for.
 *
 * The same move as the Pixelfed routes and for the same reason: the official
 * PeerTube app, Tubelab and Fedilab all exist and are good, and a client
 * somebody already has is worth more than one nobody has written. PeerTube's
 * API is not Mastodon's — different names, different ids, a different idea of
 * what a video is — so this is a translation and not an alias. The shapes live
 * in `PeerTubeApiService`; what is here is which route answers what.
 *
 * **Two things a reader should know before judging this by what is missing.**
 *
 * It is **read-only**. PeerTube's upload is a resumable protocol with a
 * transcoding state machine behind it, and a half-built one that took somebody's
 * file and lost it would be worse than none. Comments are read and not posted,
 * because a client posting through this route would go round the review queue
 * the composer goes through — the same reason the Pixelfed routes do not post
 * either.
 *
 * And it is **gated on the domain root**. No PeerTube client will ask under
 * `/apps/social/`: they all build `https://<host>/api/v1/...` from the address
 * a person types. Every route here is correct and none of them is reachable by
 * a real client until this instance answers at its own root — which is item 1
 * of the Mastodon compatibility list and a decision for whoever runs the
 * server, not something this app can do to a Nextcloud. Until then these serve
 * `curl`, the interop harness, and anybody willing to configure a rewrite.
