/**
 * Poster frames for the videos that were stored before there were any.
 *
 * A video uploaded here is given a still on its way in, and a client shows it
 * instead of a black rectangle until somebody presses play. Videos stored
 * before that existed — or on a server that had no ffmpeg when they arrived —
 * have none, and nothing was ever going to give them one: the still is made
 * from the bytes as they are written, and those bytes are only written once.
 *
 * So this reads them back and makes the still now. It is the same frame, the
 * same JPEG and the same `resized_copy` an upload gets, and it changes nothing
 * about the video itself.
 *
 * Deliberately a command rather than a background job: it is a one-off after
 * an upgrade, it spends a subprocess and a temporary copy per video, and an
 * administrator with ten thousand of them should be the one deciding when that
 * happens.
