/**
 * What the app's media is costing, and how much of it is somebody else's.
 *
 * An administrator looking at a Social instance that has grown to fifty
 * gigabytes has no way to find out what is in there. The two halves are very
 * different things: what the people here uploaded is theirs and is the only
 * copy, and what was cached off other servers is a copy that can be thrown
 * away and fetched again. Nothing told them apart, so nothing could be decided
 * about either — which is also why `cache_actor_days` (the sweep in
 * `CacheActorSweepService`) had no number an operator could put next to it.
 *
 * Both sides of the count are real: the rows come from `social_cache_doc` and
 * the size of every copy is read from appdata, the file at a time, rather than
 * from anything the row claims. A row whose file is gone is reported as such
 * instead of being counted as zero bytes.
 *
 * What it does not do is walk appdata looking for files no row names. The path
 * of a copy is derived from its own name (`aa/bb/cc/dd/<uuid>`), so finding an
 * orphan means listing a four-level tree with a directory per file, and the
 * number would not be actionable anyway — there is no safe way to delete a
 * file this app cannot name.
 *
 * No quota accounting: this is what is on disk, not what anybody is allowed.
