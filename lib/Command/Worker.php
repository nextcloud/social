/**
 * A process that drains the queues continuously, instead of every twelve
 * minutes.
 *
 * `Cron\Queue` reads **200 rows every 12 minutes** and delivers them one after
 * another with a 30-second timeout each, inside a 300-second budget. That is
 * about a thousand deliveries an hour at best and **ten** at worst — ten
 * unresponsive peers at 30 seconds each fill the whole budget. An instance
 * whose accounts are followed across twenty thousand servers therefore takes
 * the better part of a day to deliver one popular post, with every other post
 * queued behind it. Nextcloud runs one `cron.php` at a time, so there is no
 * parallelism to be had by adding servers.
 *
 * This is the same delivery, in a loop that does not stop. A healthy peer
 * answers in a fraction of a second, so one worker moves thousands of rows an
 * hour rather than a thousand a day; and because claiming a row is already
 * atomic — `setAsRunning()` is an `UPDATE … WHERE status = standby` that throws
 * when it loses the race — **several workers may run at once** and will not
 * collide. Run it under systemd with as many instances as the instance needs.
 *
 * Three things it is careful about.
 *
 * **It gives the row back.** A worker killed mid-delivery leaves the row
 * `running`, where nothing retries it until the stale reaper an hour later. So
 * every attempt that ends outside `ActivityService`'s own error handling puts
 * the row back on standby, and the loop reaps stale rows as it goes.
 *
 * **It sleeps when there is nothing to do.** An empty queue polled in a tight
 * loop is a busy CPU and a database asked the same question thousands of times
 * a second. An empty pass waits, and the wait grows to `IDLE_MAX` so an idle
 * instance costs nothing.
 *
 * **It stops when asked.** `--once` drains what is there and returns, which is
 * what a cron entry wants; `--max-seconds` gives systemd something to restart
 * around; and SIGTERM finishes the row in hand before returning, because a
 * delivery abandoned halfway is one the peer may have already taken.
 *
 * The cron job stays exactly as it is. An instance that will not run a daemon
 * keeps the behaviour it has, and one that will gets the throughput.
