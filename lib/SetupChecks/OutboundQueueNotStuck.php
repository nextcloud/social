 * Whether deliveries are leaving, or piling up.

 * Two things in the queue do not move on their own: a row the drain has
 * given up on after every retry, and a row it should have come back for a
 * day ago and has not. The first is an instance that is gone or refusing
 * us; the second is a drain that is not draining. Both are worth an
 * administrator's eye, and until now neither had one — the Federation health
 * section shows them, but only to whoever opens the Social settings.
