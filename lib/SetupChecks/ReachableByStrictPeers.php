/**
 * Whether the peers that are strict about it will talk to this instance at all.
 *
 * Federation does not fail all at once. A Nextcloud on `http://` or on a
 * private address federates happily with a permissive peer and is refused,
 * silently and at the first gate, by a strict one — so an admin sees *some*
 * of the fediverse work and has no way to tell why the rest does not.
 *
 * The strictest in common use is Pixelfed, which is also the network a photo
 * server most wants to reach. Its `Helpers::isValidUri()` refuses any scheme
 * but `https`, and `lookupPublicIps()` resolves the host through DNS —
 * ignoring `/etc/hosts` — and refuses it if any address is private. Both are
 * consulted before a signature is even checked, from its inbox, its delivery
 * and its actor fetch, with nothing to configure. Mastodon is laxer about the
 * address but still refuses plain HTTP in practice.
 *
 * Reported rather than enforced: a development instance on a LAN is a
 * perfectly good thing to be, and this says what it costs rather than
 * pretending it is broken.
