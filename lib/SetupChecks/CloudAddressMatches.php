/**
 * Whether the address Social builds every id from is still the one the server
 * says it is reachable at.
 *
 * The app copies `overwrite.cli.url` once, on its first run, and never reads
 * it again. A server renamed afterwards keeps federating under the old name:
 * WebFinger answers for a host nobody asks about, and every new post carries
 * an id that resolves nowhere. Reported and not corrected — the stored
 * address is inside every id already written.
 *
 * The ids themselves are minted from `social_url`, which on an instance set
 * up before it was derived from `cloud_url` came from the first request's
 * host and scheme, so that is compared too.
