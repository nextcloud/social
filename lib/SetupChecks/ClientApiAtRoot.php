/**
 * Whether a Mastodon client can reach this instance at all.
 *
 * The routes of the client API live under `/index.php/apps/social`, but every
 * Mastodon app is given a domain and builds `https://<domain>/api/v1/...`
 * from it; not one of them takes a path prefix. So without a web-server rule
 * that maps the root paths onto the app, adding this instance to an app fails
 * at its first request, with nothing in the app's own log to show for it.
 *
 * Nextcloud only lets a handful of apps claim root URLs, and Social is not
 * among them, so this cannot be fixed in PHP here. The check exists because
 * the alternative is an administrator who believes the app is broken: it says
 * plainly which rules are missing and where to read them.
