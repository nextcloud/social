/**
 * Whether the proxy in front of the client API tells Nextcloud the scheme.
 *
 * The rules that put the Mastodon client API at the domain root proxy to plain
 * HTTP on the loopback address. `mod_proxy` sends `X-Forwarded-For` and
 * `X-Forwarded-Host` by itself and stops there, so without
 * `RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"` Nextcloud believes every
 * proxied request arrived over `http` and builds every absolute URL it answers
 * with accordingly — on a site that is `https`.
 *
 * **Nothing about this is visible from inside.** The app answers, the routes
 * work, and the addresses in the answers are wrong. An iOS client refuses them
 * outright under App Transport Security and its sign-in stops dead, which is
 * how this was found: in a web server's access log, not in the app. Hence a
 * check — the alternative is an administrator with a working instance and a
 * client that will not sign in, and nothing anywhere connecting the two.
 *
 * Read from what the client-API probe already saw, so this costs nothing and
 * says nothing until that probe has run.
