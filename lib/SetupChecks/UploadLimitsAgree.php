/**
 * Whether PHP will accept the uploads this app promises to accept.
 *
 * Social tells every client a `max_size` — it is in `/api/v1/instance`, in
 * Pixelfed's `/api/v2/config`, and in the composer's own refusal message — and
 * PHP enforces `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size` regardless. When the
 * app's number is the larger one, a phone photograph of four megabytes is
 * offered, accepted by the client, and refused by the server with nothing in
 * the log: the request never reaches PHP's code at all, so this app cannot
 * even say what happened.
 *
 * It is the single most common "it does not work" an admin of a photo server
 * meets, it is invisible from inside the app, and it is two lines of `php.ini`
 * to fix. Nothing here changes anything: an admin might genuinely want a low
 * ceiling, in which case the app's own number is what should come down.
