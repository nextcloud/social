 * Whether `/.well-known/webfinger` answers for an account of this instance.
 *
 * Until this, the only place the probe ran was the app's own first screen,
 * for whoever happened to be an administrator and to open Social. An
 * administrator who never does — most of them — found out that nobody could
 * follow anyone here when a user asked. Administration → Overview is where
 * they already look for what is wrong with the server.
 *
 * The probe needs a real account to ask about, so it takes the oldest live
 * one rather than the administrator's own, which may not exist.
