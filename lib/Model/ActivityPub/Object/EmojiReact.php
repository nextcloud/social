/**
 * `EmojiReact`: a Like with a particular emoji on it.
 *
 * Not part of the ActivityStreams vocabulary. It comes from Misskey and is
 * implemented by Pleroma, Akkoma, Iceshrimp, Sharkey and others, and is the
 * only thing on the wire that anybody sends for a reaction, so it is what this
 * app sends and accepts. Mastodon ignores an activity type it does not know,
 * so a reaction sent to a Mastodon peer is dropped there and costs nothing.
 *
 * The emoji rides in `content`, which is the one part the implementations all
 * agree on: a single unicode emoji, or a shortcode like `:blobcat:` for a
 * custom one, with the picture in a `tag` entry. This app reads the shortcode
 * and ignores the picture — see ReactionService for why — so a custom emoji
 * from a peer is shown as the word between the colons rather than as somebody
 * else's image loaded from their server.
 *
 * A reaction with no `content` is the receiving implementation's problem to
 * name; Pleroma treats it as a plain Like. Here it is refused, because a
 * reaction bar has nothing to draw for it.
