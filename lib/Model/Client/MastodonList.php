 * Named MastodonList and not List because `list` is a reserved word in PHP and
 * `class List` does not parse.
 *
 * `id` is a string in the JSON and an integer in the row, as every other id a
 * Mastodon client is handed is: `social_list.id` is the cursor and the path
 * segment, and a client compares it as an opaque string.
 *
 * `ownerId` is not part of the entity a client sees. It is carried so that the
 * one row a request names can be checked against the account that asked before
 * anything is done with it — see ListsRequest, where the check is a SQL
 * predicate rather than a comparison made after the row was read.
