 * Mastodon's NotificationPolicy: what to do with a notification from somebody
 * the reader has no relationship with.
 *
 * Five questions, each answered with `accept` (as before), `filter` (held in
 * the requests inbox, where the reader can look at them together and decide
 * about the sender rather than about each notification) or `drop` (never
 * stored). Everything defaults to `accept`, which is what every account had
 * before this existed: a policy that starts by holding things back would
 * silently swallow notifications for accounts that never asked it to.
 *
 * The questions are about the *sender*, not about the notification, which is
 * why one decision about an account settles every notification it has sent and
 * will send.
