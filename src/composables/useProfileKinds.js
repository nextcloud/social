/**
 * What of an account can be read: its posts three ways, its collections, and
 * the photographs somebody else took of it.
 *
 * One list for the two views that draw the switcher, so that a profile's tabs
 * cannot differ depending on which of them is on screen. The three kinds of
 * post stay on the profile route with the kind in the query, as they were;
 * collections are a page of their own under the account, because they are
 * not a filter of the posts but a thing the account made out of them. Tagged
 * is a page of its own for the opposite reason: the posts on it are not the
 * account's at all — they are everybody else's photographs that it is named
 * in, which is why it is the last of the five rather than beside Photos.
 *
 * @param {string} account the handle in the route
 * @return {Array<{value: string, label: string, icon: object, to: object}>}
