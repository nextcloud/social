 * "Share to Social" in the Files app.

 * The composer could already attach a picture that is on the server, through
 * its own file picker. This is the same road walked from the other end: a
 * reader looking at the picture in Files, where the thought "I want to post
 * this" actually occurs, gets an action that carries it into the composer.
 *
 * Deliberately small. The Files page is opened far more often than a post is
 * written from it, and this script is loaded on every one of those pages, so
 * it registers the action and nothing else: no framework, no composer, no
 * store. The work happens in the app, which is where the composer lives; this
 * only hands over the paths, in the URL, and the app's navigation reads them.
