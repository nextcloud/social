 * every option was as wide as the widest of them, and seven of those ran past
 * the column. An option is as wide as its own words now and the pill is
 * measured rather than assumed, so the squeeze is gone and the row keeps the
 * spacing every other switcher has.
 *
 * What is still needed is the point where even that stops fitting: below this
 * width the labels give way to the icons they sit beside, staying in the
 * accessibility tree because the label is the option's name. The switcher does
 * the same thing itself further down; this only brings the point forward for a
 * row twice as long as the ones it was built for.
