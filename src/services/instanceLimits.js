 * The composer, the inline editor and the Files action each carried their own
 * `500` and `10`, which were the server's numbers on the day they were typed
 * and nothing kept them so. The server publishes both in the instance entity
 * (`configuration.statuses.max_characters`, `max_media_attachments`), which
 * is where every other client reads them from; this reads them from the same
 * place and falls back to the old constants until it has.
 *
 * Framework-free on purpose: the Files action is loaded on every Files page
 * without Vue, Pinia or axios, and has to be able to ask too.
