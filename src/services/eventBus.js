 *
 * It goes through the bus rather than the card owning a picker because
 * `@nextcloud/vue` must not be imported anywhere under `TimelinePost` — that
 * component is in both the app's entry and the dashboard's, and a framework
 * import beneath it moves the shared l10n chunk out of `social-framework` and
 * copies it into each entry. See `tests/js/bundles.test.js`, which pins the
 * sizes this would have broken.
