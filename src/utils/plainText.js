 * and re-drafted must come back as the same text — which is why this is one
 * function and not two.
 *
 * Block elements end in a newline and `<br>` is a newline, because that is
 * what `LinkifyService` made of the newlines on the way out. Everything else
 * contributes its text and nothing else: a mention arrives as a link around a
 * handle, and the handle is what was typed.
