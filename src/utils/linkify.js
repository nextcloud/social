/**
 * What the server will make a link of, found in the browser.
 *
 * This is a mirror of `lib/Service/LinkifyService.php`, which is what actually
 * publishes a post: it finds the URLs, mentions and hashtags in the typed text
 * and builds the outbound HTML around them. The composer cannot ask the server
 * what a half-typed post will look like on every keystroke, so the same rules
 * are applied here to show the writer what is about to become a link.
 *
 * Because it is a mirror, it must not drift: the two are pinned together by
 * `tests/js/utils/linkify.test.js`, which runs the same cases the PHP unit
 * test runs. If the server's rules change, this changes with them — a preview
 * that promises a mention the server will not send is worse than no preview.
 *
 * What this does **not** do is decide whether a mention resolves to somebody.
 * The server only links an entity the `tag` array vouches for, and it can only
 * build that array by looking accounts up. A mention shown here is therefore
 * "this is a mention", not "this account exists".

/**
 * The one pass over the text, the same alternation the server uses.
 *
 * URLs come first so that everything inside one belongs to it: a `#section`
 * fragment is part of the link and not a hashtag, and `/@bob` in a path names
 * no account. A mention is not preceded by a word character or `@`, which
 * keeps `frank@example.org` an email address; a hashtag is not preceded by a
 * word character (`issue#42`) nor by `&`, which would make an HTML entity into
 * one.
