/**
 * The code points of an emoji, as the filename its image is stored under.
 *
 * This is the one function the app used the `twemoji` package for, and the
 * package brought a few hundred kilobytes and its whole asset index into the
 * bundle to provide it. The images themselves are shipped in `img/twemoji/`,
 * so all that was ever needed was the name.
 *
 * Surrogate pairs are combined back into the single code point they encode;
 * everything else is emitted as it stands, which is what keeps the zero-width
 * joiners and variation selectors of a composed emoji in the name.
 *
 * @param {string} emoji one emoji, composed or not
 * @param {string} separator between code points, `-` as the filenames use
 * @return {string} lowercase hex code points, e.g. `1f468-200d-1f469-200d-1f467`
