 * scrolling. The number that matters is not how many are drawn but how many
 * cold pictures are in flight at once: a browser opens six connections to a

 * the whole reason it is not simply the Files picker that sits beside it.

 * Choosing one does not download and re-upload it: the server copies the
 * library file into an attachment, through the same path an upload takes. See
