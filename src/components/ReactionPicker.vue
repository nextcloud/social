 * under `TimelinePost`, which the app's entry and the dashboard's both pull
 * in — a framework import beneath it moves the shared l10n chunk out of
 * `social-framework` and copies half a megabyte into each entry.
 *
 * So the card asks, over the bus, and hands a callback with it; this opens,
 * takes the answer, and gives it back. The request stays with the card.
