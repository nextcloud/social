 *
 * `NcAppNavigationSettings` animates its own `max-height`, so the panel grew
 * and the rows inside it were simply there when it finished -- the container
 * moved and its contents did not. These scale up from 82%, overshooting a
 * little on the way (the tail of the easing curve goes past 1), so the menu
 * reads as growing out of the button rather than as a list that was already
 * written and got uncovered.
 *
 * **An animation and not a transition, because a transition cannot run here.**
 * The panel is held by `v-show`, so while the menu is shut it is
 * `display: none` and its rows are not rendered at all. An element that was
 * not rendered has no previous value to transition *from*, so the browser
 * jumps straight to the final one: the rows appeared fully formed, all eight
 * at once, and the stagger this file has carried since it was written never
 * ran a single time. The delay was computed correctly and thrown away. A
 * keyframe animation does start when an element is first rendered, which is
 * exactly the moment in question.
 *
 * The stagger runs from the bottom row up, which is the direction the panel
 * itself grows: it is anchored at the foot of the sidebar, so an opening
 * drawer pushes its own top edge upward. Rows appearing the other way would
 * travel against it. There is nothing to mirror for right-to-left -- a scale
 * has no leading edge -- so the drawer is the same in both.
 *
 * Driven off `aria-expanded`, which is the accordion's own state and the only
 * hook it offers: there is no `open` prop and no event, and the component's
 * internal class names are content-hashed, so anything keyed on those would
 * break on the next release of the library.
 *
 * The delay comes from `--entry-index` and `--entry-total`, both set in the
 * template. The DOM cannot be counted here: `NcAppNavigationItem` puts every
 * entry in a wrapper of its own, so each one is its parent's first child and
 * `nth-child` hands them all the same delay -- and `nth-last-child`, which
 * would give the bottom-up order directly, fails for the same reason. There
 * are tests that they are laid out that way and that the total matches the
 * number of entries, so these comments stop being true loudly rather than
 * quietly.
 *
 * Nothing here needs an `@supports` guard any more. Where `:has()` is not
 * supported the whole rule is invalid and dropped, and because the resting
 * state of a row is now its own -- opacity and scale live in the keyframes,
 * not in a base rule -- what is left is a menu that opens without animating.
 * The guard existed to stop a bare `opacity: 0` from leaving it permanently
 * empty, and there is no longer a bare `opacity: 0`.

 * 14px circle, with 8px of air around it. Rounded all the way, the two are the

 * the badge inside. At the 8px corner this button used to have, the same ring
 * cut across the disc instead of agreeing with it.
