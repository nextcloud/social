/**
 * What the administrators of this server are telling everybody.
 *
 * An announcement was reachable only over the client API until this existed:
 * an admin could post "we are moving servers on Friday" and nobody reading the
 * web client would ever be told. It goes at the top of the timeline because
 * that is the page people are on, above the composer, where it is read before
 * anything is written.
 *
 * **An unread announcement interrupts; a read one does not.** The card is
 * drawn only when something in the list was unread at the moment the page
 * loaded, so a reader who has dealt with the notices never scrolls past this
 * again. What was already read is not shown, but while the card is up a
 * disclosure at its foot brings it back — somebody who dismissed one too
 * quickly is one press away from it for the rest of the visit.
 *
 * Dismissing does not take the announcement off the screen. `read` is what
 * changes: the notice stays where it was with its dismissal button gone and a
 * "Read" mark in its place, because a card that vanishes under the cursor
 * takes the sentence the reader was halfway through with it. It is gone on the
 * next visit, and gone on every other device the account uses — the dismissal
 * is stored per account by the server, not in this browser.
 *
 * Nothing of this is on the public page. An announcement is what the instance
 * tells its *accounts*, and the route behind it needs a viewer: a reader who is
 * not logged in would get a 401 for a card they are not meant to see.
 *
 * Nothing is done here about a window that has not opened or has closed:
 * `GET /api/v1/announcements` compares the bounds in its own query, so an
 * announcement outside its window is never in the answer. One with an end is
 * shown with it ("Until 21 September"), which is the half of a window a reader
 * can act on.
