/**
 * Deleting your own Social account, and keeping your Nextcloud one.
 *
 * `occ social:account:delete` was the only way to do this, so somebody who
 * wanted their fediverse presence gone had to ask an administrator — which
 * means explaining to a colleague why.
 *
 * Two things stand in front of it, and neither is a password: an account
 * signed in through SSO has none to give. The button asks first, and then the
 * handle has to be typed out. The page is reloaded afterwards rather than
 * patched, because what is left of this session is a client holding the state
 * of an account that no longer exists.
