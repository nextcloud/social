 *
 * The box is the shape the media actually is. There used to be a floor of 3:4
 * and a ceiling of 16:9 here, and anything outside them was reshaped to fit: a
 * 9:16 short -- which is what a phone records, and what the comment beside the
 * floor claimed to allow -- was given a 3:4 box and had its top and bottom cut
 * off by the `cover` the frame is drawn with. A tall frame still must not take
 * over a timeline, so `GalleryMedia` caps how tall one may be *drawn*. That
 * bounds the frame without reshaping the picture: what will not fit is made
 * smaller, never cropped.
