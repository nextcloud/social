/**
 * A row of places to be, with a pill that travels between them.
 *
 * It was written for the three timelines a reader moves between all day, which
 * were a sidebar entry each — and a sidebar entry is where you go for a place
 * you *visit*. Those three are the same place seen from three distances, and
 * switching between them is something you do while reading rather than
 * something you navigate to; Mastodon and every client of it put them side by
 * side above the posts for that reason. A profile's Posts, Photos and Videos
 * are the same shape of choice, so they are the same control.
 *
 * Hand-built rather than `NcCheckboxRadioSwitch`, for the one thing that
 * component cannot do: a single indicator that *travels* between the options.
 * Several buttons that light up tell you where you landed; one pill that
 * slides tells you where you came from, which is what makes a switch feel like
 * a switch. The cost is the accessibility, which is therefore done here in
 * full — a real `radiogroup`, arrow keys, a roving tabindex — rather than left
 * to a set of links dressed up as tabs.
 *
 * It decides nothing itself. An option that carries a route pushes it, so the
 * page it sits on stays the one answer to what is being shown; an option with
 * no route is a choice the page holds itself, and the pick is handed back as
 * `update:value` for that page to act on — Discover's four lists are one
 * screen and not four, so they are state there rather than four routes. The
 * words in the routes are the route's own — `timeline` for the local feed,
 * `federated` for the global one, `image` and `video` for the kinds of
 * attachment the API knows — rather than the labels beside them, because two
 * vocabularies would be one more place for the two to disagree.
