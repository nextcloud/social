 * How the reader's week went, if they asked to be told.
 *
 * Off until it is switched on in the settings. A card that turns up in
 * somebody's feed to comment on how much they have posted is something to ask
 * for, not something to be given, and this one is deliberately dull about it:
 * a count, the week before for comparison, and nothing that frames a quiet
 * week as a failure.
 *
 * There is no streak. A run of consecutive weeks is a thing that can be lost,
 * and a feed that tells somebody they have broken one is asking them for posts
 * rather than offering them anything. A quiet week gets a way into the local
 * timeline instead — what other people have been writing is the useful answer
 * to "you have not posted", and it asks nothing.
