/**
 * Saving a post is one fact, against the real database.
 *
 * A post is stored as a row in `social_stream` and then a row per recipient in
 * `social_stream_dest` — and the recipient rows are what put it in a timeline.
 * Written outside a transaction, a failure between the two left a post that
 * exists, is in nobody's timeline, and that nothing ever notices: the recipient
 * insert logged its failure and carried on.
 *
 * These are integration tests because a transaction is a database behaviour;
 * there is nothing to assert about it without one, and the two halves of it —
 * a failure must roll the post back, a duplicate must not — cannot both be
 * checked against a double.
