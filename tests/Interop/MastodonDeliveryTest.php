/**
 * This app's activities, delivered to a real Mastodon and read back out of it.
 *
 * The Pixelfed work found three silent drops by running our payloads through
 * Pixelfed's own validators; nothing equivalent had ever been done for
 * Mastodon, and Mastodon is the implementation almost everybody on the other
 * end is running. A unit test can prove this app emits the document it meant
 * to. Only this can prove Mastodon *accepts* it — the difference between the
 * two being exactly where a silent drop lives.
 *
 * **Nothing is stubbed.** The post is written through `PostService`, the
 * delivery is the real queue signed by the real signer, and what is asserted is
 * what Mastodon's own API answers — not a row in its database, because a row
 * its serialiser refuses to render has not arrived either.
 *
 * **Mastodon follows us first.** A post reaches an instance because somebody
 * there follows its author; making Mastodon follow our account is therefore
 * both the setup and the first assertion, since Mastodon will only follow an
 * actor whose document it could fetch and understand.
 *
 * Skipped, with a reason, when there is no Mastodon to talk to: see
 * `tests/Interop/README.md` and `.github/workflows/interop-mastodon.yml`.
