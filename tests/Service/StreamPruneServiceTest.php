/**
 * Retention for other servers' posts.
 *
 * What is asserted here is the part that decides whether anything is deleted
 * at all, and the queue sweep beside it. The prunable query itself is not:
 * it is assembled against `IQueryBuilder`, whose `expr()` returns an
 * `IExpressionBuilder` that cannot be loaded — let alone doubled — in a suite
 * that runs without a database, which is the same reason `FakeExpressions`
 * exists next door. Its protection rules are the app's most destructive piece
 * of SQL and belong in an integration test against a real schema.
