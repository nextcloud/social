/**
 * The indexes the app's hot queries cannot do without.
 *
 * This app has ninety-odd indexes across its migrations and nothing that says
 * which of them anything depends on. That is how a regression gets in: an
 * index is dropped or renamed in a migration written for another reason,
 * every test still passes, and the home timeline goes from fifty milliseconds
 * to a second and a half on an instance nobody can reproduce locally. It has
 * happened here before — `docs/Architecture.md` records the 1,661 ms home
 * timeline and what fixed it.
 *
 * A query plan test would be better and cannot be written here: `EXPLAIN` needs
 * a database with data in it, the unit suite has neither, and a plan is a
 * judgement of the planner rather than of the schema. What *can* be pinned is
 * the thing a plan depends on — that the index exists, on those columns, in
 * that order — and that is what this does. A column list is meaningful in
 * order: an index on (a, b) answers a query filtering on `a`, and one on
 * (b, a) does not.
 *
 * Adding a row here is how a future query says "this is load-bearing".
