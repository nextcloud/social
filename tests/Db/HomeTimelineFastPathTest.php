/**
 * When the fast home-timeline query refuses to answer.
 *
 * It pages over the recipient rows' own sort key and is the reason a home
 * timeline is 50 ms rather than 1,661; the old query joins and sorts and is
 * slower and always correct. Every rule about when the fast one may *not* be
 * used is therefore a correctness rule, and each is asserted against the real
 * method rather than against a copy of its condition — a test that restated
 * the rule would pass whatever the code did.
 *
 * All four refusals happen before the query touches the database, which is what
 * makes them testable without one.
