/**
 * A home page that filtering emptied reads on instead of ending the timeline.
 *
 * The fast page query chooses its page over one column and carries none of the
 * per-viewer filters; blocks, mutes and hidden boosts are applied to the rows
 * it chose. Reading three times the limit covers a page that loses a few posts
 * that way. It does not cover one that loses all of them — a muted account that
 * has just posted sixty times in a row — and an empty page is how both clients
 * read "there is nothing more": the web app sets `allLoaded` on a page of zero,
 * and no `Link: rel="next"` is sent. The timeline ended in the middle, with
 * older posts the reader can see sitting a few hundred rows further down.
